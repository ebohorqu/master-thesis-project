# Bird Flock Behavior Clustering

This project simulates and analyzes the collective behavior of bird flocks using an agent-based model. The goal is to identify and cluster behavioral patterns such as migration, mobbing, and nesting transitions.

## 📌 Motivation

Collective behavior is key to understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics. This project adapts work from my Master’s thesis and applies unsupervised learning to classify flock structures.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn (clustering, PCA)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` — synthetic datasets from simulations
- `notebooks/` — step-by-step modeling
- `src/` — core simulation and analysis code

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
